# rainr - discord.py templates<br>

## rainr is a program made in rust to provide simple discord.py templates that are quick and easy to use.<br> 

## usage<br>
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rainr/rainr.git
cd rainr
cargo build --release
cd target/release
./rainr <template> <file>
```
you can also add it to your path to use it anywhere with `rainr <template> <file>`<br>

theres 2 templates to choose from: basic & commands<br>
commands - includes the 3 slash commands: ping, addition & kick<br>
basic - is a ***basic*** template with the ping command. you could add the commands from the commands template.<br>

## why?<br>
boredom and because these are commands i use in my own bots and i want to easily be able to access them without writing the same code over and over again.
